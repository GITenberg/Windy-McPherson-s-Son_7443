description: '"In the restaurant the young man began talking of himself. He was a
  graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. His father had died while he was yet
  in school and had left him a modest fortune, upon the income of which he lived with
  his mother. He did no work and was enormously proud of the fact."--Publisher''s
